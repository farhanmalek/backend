### About
I wanted to try and learn C#, therefore I practiced by building a Real Time Chat Application using ASPNetCore and Microsoft SQL Server.

Tech Used
- ASP NetCore and MS Entity Framework for API development and Database Interactions
- SignalR for real time capabilites.

Features
- A user is able to send and receive messages by creating chats in real time from an individual or within a group.
- A user is able to send and receive friend requests to other users through searching in real time.
